## Should we capture infrastructure logs?

The latest ASPNET Core has some amazing [diagnostics and logging capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging) built in, and Serilog has a great way to [capture these logs](https://nblumhardt.com/2015/05/diagnostic-logging-in-dnx-asp-net-5/) so they can be sent to the same destinations (sinks) as your application is configured. When you are diagnosing or understanding how the framework is impacting the behavior of your software, this feature can be a real life saver.

However, in my recent experience, this is the not the normal situation. Most of the issues I'm dealing with are related to my own application's code; the application I'm working on. Only occasionally do the issues with my application seem to overlap with ASPNET Core enough that I feel the need to dive into the ASPNET Core logs.

This means I _typically_ don't want to capture and store the vast amounts of diagnostic logs produced by ASPNET Core or other components that use [MEL](https://github.com/aspnet/Logging) (like [EntityFrameworkCore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/logging)).

On the other hand, when something does go wrong, I *do* want to be able to capture and analyse these logs!

## Too much information

The volume of logs generated by ASPNET Core can be quite large. If you have them turned on full, they would typically _drown out_ the logs generated by your own application. A great way (and the most common way) to _dial down_ the volume of logging generated from ASPNET Core is to use [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Filter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Filter):

```csharp
var factory = new LoggerFactory()
    .UseConfiguration(loggingConfiguration.GetSection("Logging"))
    .AddFilter(new Dictionary<string, LogLevel>
    {
        { "Microsoft", LogLevel.Warning },
        { "System", LogLevel.Warning },
        { "SampleApp.Program", LogLevel.Debug }
    });
```

In Serilog, we can achieve something similar by using [`MimimumLevel.Override`](https://nblumhardt.com/2016/07/serilog-2-minimumlevel-override/):

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .MinimumLevel.Information()
    .MinimumLevel.Override("Microsoft", LogEventLevel.Warning)
    .WriteTo.Sink(new MyFancySink())
    .CreateLogger();
```

This ensures that any logs with a source (aka [Log category](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging#log-category)) of `"Microsoft"` is ignored unless it is at _minimum_ `LogEventLevel.Warning`. This is a really simple and flexible approach; it allows you to _zero in_ on the Loggers that come from the `Microsoft` category, or even go deeper.

Let's say that I am using EF Core, and I suspect there's an issue with one of the SQL queries it has translated from LINQ into SQL. I can enable verbose logging _only_ for the EF Core sources:

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .MinimumLevel.Verbose()
    .MinimumLevel.Override("Microsoft", LogEventLevel.Warning)
    .MinimumLevel.Override("Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore", LogEventLevel.Verbose)
    .WriteTo.LiterateConsole(
        outputTemplate: "[{Timestamp:HH:mm:ss} {Level:u3}] {Message} [{SourceContext}]{NewLine}{Exception}")
    .CreateLogger();
```

The amount of information I am presented with is far less than if I had enabled `Verbose` for _everything_ instead of just `"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore"`.

## Remotely controlling the log level with Seq

[Seq](https://getseq.net/) provides one of the best experiences for dealing with logs generated by Serilog and ASPNET Core / Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.

Serilog provides the ability to [dynamically change the log level](https://nblumhardt.com/2014/10/dynamically-changing-the-serilog-level/), and [Seq can make use of this feature](https://nblumhardt.com/2016/02/remote-level-control-in-serilog-using-seq/). Using the Seq admin screens

![Seq Dynamic Level Control](https://nblumhardt.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DynamicLevelControl.png)
Unfortunately, at the time of writing, Seq doesn't yet have the ability to remotely control the verbosity at individual source/context levels.

What we **can** do now is to use a separate Serilog Logger with a separate Seq API Key for our major log sources. This allows using the existing Seq and Serilog dynamic level control features to control our ASPNET Core logging, without impacting the logs generated by our application explicitly.

For example, during our ASPNET Core Startup, we can do the following:

```csharp
public void Configure(
    IApplicationBuilder app,
    IHostingEnvironment env,
    ILoggerFactory loggerFactory,
    IApplicationLifetime appLifetime)
{
    var infrastructureLevelSwitch = new LoggingLevelSwitch(
        SeqConfig.AspNetInfrastructureSeqMinimumLevel);

    loggerFactory.AddSerilog(new LoggerConfiguration()
        .MinimumLevel.ControlledBy(infrastructureLevelSwitch)
        .Enrich.FromLogContext()
        .WriteTo.Seq(
            serverUrl: SeqConfig.AspNetInfrastructureSeqServerUrl,
            apiKey: SeqConfig.AspNetInfrastructureSeqApiKey,
            controlLevelSwitch: infrastructureLevelSwitch)
        .CreateLogger(), dispose: true);
}
```

Notice that we created an entirely new `Logger`, and did not assign it to the shared static Serilog `Log.Logger`. All we did was pass it into the the ASPNET Core `loggerFactory` and the [Serilog.Extensions.Logging `AddSerilog` extension method](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-extensions-logging/).

That's it! Now that you have a separate [API Key](http://docs.getseq.net/docs/api-keys), you can use Seq to control the log level as usual:

## Some things to keep in mind

* If you start [using MEL for your own application logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging#how-to-create-logs) you may need to tweak or entirely rethink this strategy.
* It can take anywhere from seconds to minutes for the log level change in Seq to be propagated out to the [Serilog.Sinks.Seq](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-seq) clients, so keep this in mind.
* You will need to be sure that in the event you need to enable this logging, that you are prepared for the deluge of additional log events. Turning on full (default) ASPNET core and EF logging on a busy production system might give you some different headaches!
